# **Neuer: A Framework? Nah, Just Code.**

Welcome to **Neuer**, the one framework that doesn't give a damn about **frameworks**. It’s **code**. Pure and simple. We didn’t need to overcomplicate it, and neither should you. So, if you’re here looking for **rules**, **patterns**, or some **"best practices"** to follow—good luck. **Neuer** is for **people who just want to ship code**. 

### **In the Beginning, There Was Code...**

Once upon a time, in the good ol’ days, we wrote code. Simple, powerful code. And everything just worked. But then, the framework **overlords** descended from their high castles, armed with their fancy terms like **SSR**, **CSR**, and **"the most elegant state management system"**. They built towering frameworks of complexity, wrapped in buzzwords, selling the idea that “**best practices**” were the ultimate goal. Well, guess what? **It’s all a damn lie.**

Fast forward to now, and we’ve got more dependencies than we know what to do with, and yet—nothing ever **just works** anymore.

Enter: **Neuer**.

### **Neuer Zen** (A.k.a, The Rules of Code… If You Need 'Em)

- **There is no framework. There is only code.**  
  Stop kidding yourself. Frameworks are just code dressed in fancy clothes. **Neuer** doesn’t need layers, abstraction, or complex tools to be called a framework. It’s **just JavaScript** doing its thing. You’re writing code. Deal with it.

- **You don’t need a 12-step guide to create a button.**  
  If your UI framework requires 10 steps just to make a **button clickable**, maybe your “framework” is the problem, not you. **Neuer** just makes things happen. You click, it reacts. Done. No fanfare, no complexity.

- **Complexity is a lie.**  
  The tech world loves to sell you complexity like it’s some form of sophistication. The truth? Complexity is just a **failure** to solve a problem simply. When the big dogs talk about their “elegant systems” and “next-level architectures,” just smile and nod. **Neuer** doesn’t care about making things **look hard**. We care about getting things done **fast** and **elegantly**—whether the experts approve or not.

- **Declarative? Procedural? Just do what works.**  
  You’ve spent enough time arguing about paradigms. Declarative, procedural, functional—doesn’t matter. If it works, it works. **Neuer** is whatever it needs to be. **Declarative when you need it**, **procedural when you don't**—and if you need both, we’ll make you think it was your idea. **Get shit done.**

- **The only constant is change.**  
  That “perfect” architecture you spent six months developing? Cute. Tomorrow, it’s obsolete. The tech world moves fast. If you can’t keep up, **Neuer** doesn’t care. We adapt. **Fast.**

- **Keep it simple, but don’t be afraid to hack.**  
  We love when you try to follow all those **purity rules**. Keep it abstract. Keep it clean. But let’s face it—if you want to actually build something, sometimes you need to **hack**. **Neuer** isn’t afraid of rough edges. We’re here to get stuff done, not to win a prize for perfect code.

- **Abstractions are for the weak.**  
  Three months of refactoring to make everything “elegant”? Nah, not here. You touch the code. You own the code. If you can’t handle that, maybe you're not ready for **Neuer**. We don't hide behind **layers of indirection**.

- **If it works, you don’t need a reason.**  
  You don’t need to justify every line of code. If it works, it **works**. Don’t waste time explaining. Don’t waste time trying to make it perfect. **Neuer** just works. And if you don’t get it, that’s cool—move along. There are no explanations here.

- **You’re frustrated with frameworks.**  
  You've been stuck in the mud of framework bureaucracy. You've written thousands of lines of code that no one understands. You’re sick of re-building the same **"perfect systems"** over and over. **Neuer** is your escape. **Fast. Direct. Unapologetic.** If you don’t like it, great—go back to your complicated frameworks. **We’ll be over here shipping code.**

- **In the end, results are all that matter.**  
  Forget about **scalability**, **modularity**, and **reuse**. Your users don’t care about your **perfect architecture** or your **state management patterns**. They just want stuff to work. **Neuer** delivers results. **Fast**. Simple. **Done.** No debates. No excuses.

### **Getting Started (If You Must)**

#### **INSTALLATION: AS EASY AS WE ARE BRILLIANT.**

```bash
npm install neuer
```

#### **USAGE: EVEN YOUR DOG COULD DO THIS.**

```html
<script type="module" src='./dist/neuer.es.js'></script>
<script defer>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {
        moduleManager.attachModule('my-container', 'my-module', {
            prop1: 'value1',
            prop2: 'value2',
        });
    });
</script>
```

Done. You’re welcome.

Neuer’s here. It’s about time you figured out what that means. **Now get out there and build something that actually works.**

#### **QUESTIONS? WE'RE TOO BUSY REDEFINING EXCELLENCE.**
Got questions about Neuer? Take a breath, hit pause on your doubt, and **read the README again.** We've crafted it to answer even those questions you haven't thought of yet.

- Got a real issue? Describe it like you're talking to someone who’s not a mind reader (which we're not, despite the rumors).

Remember, every minute we spend fixing your “bugs” is a minute we're not making Neuer mind-blowingly awesome. So, think before you click.
