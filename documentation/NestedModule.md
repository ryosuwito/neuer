### **Neuer: Swapping Modules Like a Boss, With Nested Components—NO PROBLEMS, NO HASSLES**

---

#### **Here’s the Deal:**

You’ve been **battling** with the Big Three. You know the drill: **prop drilling**, **state lifting**, **complex slot handling**. But here comes **Neuer**, the cocky little framework that could. 

And guess what? It makes **module swapping** and **nested component rendering** look like a **walk in the park**. Here’s how you do it—**no sweat, no fuss**.

---

### **What Are We Doing Here?**
You’re about to witness **dynamic module swapping**. That’s right, swapping your modules into **slots** and **rendering nested components** in the most **stupidly simple** way. You’ll think **the Big Three are stuck in the stone age** once you see how **Neuer** does it.

### **The Code (Get Ready for Pure Magic)**

```html
<div id="app"></div>

<script>
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', async () => {

        // Father Container Module
        class FatherContainer extends Neuer {
            static get observedAttributes() {
                return ['data-name'];
            }

            constructor() {
                super({ name: 'fatherContainer' });
            }

            connectedCallback() {
                const htmlContent = `
                    <div>
                        <p>Hey <span v-name></span>, wassap!</p>
                        <slot></slot>
                    </div>
                `;
                super.connectedCallback(htmlContent);
            }
        }

        // Kid Module
        class TheKid extends Neuer {
            static get observedAttributes() {
                return ['data-greetings'];
            }

            constructor() {
                super({ name: 'theKid' });
            }

            connectedCallback() {
                const htmlContent = `<h1 v-greetings></h1>`;
                super.connectedCallback(htmlContent);
            }
        }

        // Register the modules
        customElements.define('the-kid', TheKid);
        customElements.define('father-container', FatherContainer);

        // Dynamically Attach the Modules
        await moduleManager.attachModule('app', 'father-container', { name: 'Kiddo' }, [
            {
                moduleName: 'the-kid',
                props: {
                    greetings: 'Hey Dad!'
                }
            },
            {
                moduleName: 'the-kid',
                props: {
                    greetings: 'Hey Mom!'
                }
            }
        ]);
    });
</script>
```

### **What Just Happened Here?**

1. **Father Container Module**:
   - You created the **`FatherContainer`** module (aka the **parent** component) with a **slot**. This allows the parent to **inject child modules** (the kids, literally) into its content. 
   - It includes a `<span>` to display the name of the kid (dynamic binding). Inside, there’s a **slot** where we can insert any module we want. **That’s flexibility at its finest.**

2. **The Kid Module**:
   - Now you have the **`TheKid`** module (aka the **child** component). It’s a simple module that takes a **greeting** and displays it in an `<h1>`. 
   - You can pass any greeting, and that child module will render it.

3. **Dynamic Module Attachment**:
   - With **`moduleManager.attachModule()`**, you dynamically attach the `father-container` module to the `#app` div. It takes the `name` prop for the kid’s name.
   - But the real **magic** happens when you pass the **children modules** into the parent. These are **the-kid modules**, each with their own unique greeting. 
   - The **`slot`** in `father-container` takes care of **rendering the kids** without needing to hard-code anything. **It’s automatic**.

4. **No Rebuilds, No Fuss**:
   - **No need to touch the UI**. The modules are attached and swapped dynamically.
   - No need for **`useState`**, **`props drilling`**, or **`v-bind`**. Just attach and **boom**, the kids are rendered **in the parent**.

---

### **Why Is This So Ridiculously Easy (And Impossible for the Big Three)?**

1. **Dynamic Slot Injection**:
   - **Neuer’s slot system** makes it **easy as hell** to inject child modules into a parent component, dynamically. **No need to manually pass props** or manage state—just drop the modules in and go.

2. **No Prop Drilling**:
   - **React?** Good luck with all that **state lifting** and **prop drilling**. You’ve gotta **manually pass data** down the component tree. And don’t even get started on **context providers**—they’re a nightmare.
   - **Vue?** Yeah, you can use **`v-slot`**, but it’s **not as simple**, and it **definitely isn’t dynamic**. You’re still managing props, passing data, and hoping everything gets rendered correctly.
   - **Angular?** **Services, DI, `ngOnChanges`**, **`ng-content`**, and all the verbose **TypeScript boilerplate**. Good luck dealing with that **crap** for something as simple as slot injection.

3. **No Build Tools or Boilerplate**:
   - **Neuer** doesn’t need a **build process** or **CLI setup**. Just load the script, define your components, and use `moduleManager` to attach them. **Boom**, done. 
   - **React?** You’re pulling in **Webpack**, **Babel**, and a **billion other dependencies**.
   - **Vue?** Maybe you can use **Vue CLI**, but you still need **npm scripts**, **bundling**, and a **vue-loader**.
   - **Angular?** Please. **Angular CLI**, **TypeScript**, **modules**, **components**, and **services**—the complexity is real. 

4. **Flexibility Without the Fuss**:
   - **Neuer’s simplicity** lets you swap modules around like **LEGO bricks**. Want to change the kids? Just swap the module in the slot. Want to update the father’s name? **Just update the prop**, and it’s done.
   - **React, Vue, and Angular**? You’re setting up **state management**, **hooks**, or **computed properties** just to **pass data** between components. **Not with Neuer**. 

---

### **The Neuer Flex:**

- **Modules?** Inject them on the fly. **No problem**.
- **Slots?** Bind them dynamically with ease. **Done**.
- **State management?** We don’t need no stinkin’ state management—just fire up the `moduleManager`, and modules talk to each other like a well-oiled machine.
- **Build tools?** **Forget it**. **No Webpack, no Babel, no CLI.** Just pure code and pure simplicity.
- **Overriding?** Sure, just swap out the components on the fly and re-render them. **Done.**

---

### **Can The Big Three Do This?**

You bet **they can’t**. The complexity, the setup, the boilerplate—they’re all **too much for something as simple as module swapping**. And when you need **nested components**? You’d be **swimming in state management and event systems**.

With **Neuer**, you just slap down a `<slot>`, **inject the modules**, and let them **communicate** through **simple events**. It’s **dynamic**, **flexible**, and **minimal**.

---

### **The TL;DR**:  
**Neuer makes swapping and nesting modules a joke. The Big Three? They're too busy wrestling with complex systems and dependencies to even think about it.**  
**Neuer makes it stupidly simple.**
