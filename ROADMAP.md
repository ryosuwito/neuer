# **NEUER ROADMAP: THE FUTURE WE’LL ASSEMBLE WHEN WE DAMN WELL PLEASE**

### **"DEADLINES? LOL, NO."**  

If you're expecting a precise timeline, you’re in the wrong universe. Neuer doesn’t do deadlines, roadmaps, or “quarterly deliverables.” That’s for suits and Jira jockeys. We do brilliance—and brilliance takes its sweet time. 

Looking for a gantt chart? Go buy a wall calendar and cry over it. Here, we offer **vision**, not timelines. Neuer’s philosophy is simple: **it’ll ship when it’s genius enough to blow your mind.**

## **1. STUFF WE’LL PROBABLY DELIVER (WHEN WE FEEL LIKE IT)**  

### **"Fetch Mode": Module Lazy Loading**  
Why load everything upfront like it’s 2010? With Neuer, you’ll load modules only when you need them—like a true minimalist. This isn’t laziness; it’s efficiency disguised as brilliance.



### **Built-In Theming System**  
Your designer wants **“modern pastels”** today and **“edgy dark mode”** tomorrow? Neuer’s theming system will handle it—global, local, and everything in between. You’ll even think we care about CSS. Spoiler: **we don’t.**



### **Inter-Module Communication**  
Imagine your modules talking to each other, sharing data, and coordinating their brilliance like a squad of web development Avengers. That’s the future we’re building. You’re welcome.



### **Developer Mode: Debugger Dashboard**  
Stop hunting for bugs in the console like a caveman. Neuer will give you a dashboard so slick you’ll wonder how you ever coded without it. No prayers, no guesswork, just actual debugging tools.



### **Universal Adapters**  
Backend in PHP, Go, or something you coded at 3 AM and now regret? Doesn’t matter. If it speaks JSON (or even grunts it), Neuer will handle it like a boss.



### **Registry Admin 2.0: Modules Managing Modules**  
A module manager for your modules. It’s Neuerception. Track, control, and tweak everything without breaking a sweat. You’re about to feel like the web’s version of Tony Stark.



### **The Storybook Killer**  
You love Storybook? Cute. Neuer’s upcoming playground will let you test, tweak, and demo your modules in real time—no extra files, no boilerplate. Storybook can stay in the corner and watch.

## **2. RELEASE CYCLES: WHEN WE’RE GOOD AND READY**  

### **New Releases: AKA "Drops of Brilliance"**  
Neuer updates don’t follow some corporate release cycle. They happen when we’ve got something so good we can’t keep it to ourselves. Think of it as Christmas, but better.



### **LTS (Long-Term Sassiness)**  
Need stability? Fine. Every now and then, we’ll declare a version LTS, which means you can trust it to work flawlessly while we’re busy inventing the next great thing.



### **Experimental Features**  
Got a wild idea? Neuer will ship it as experimental. You’ll either love it or think it’s bonkers—but that’s part of the fun.

## **3. THINGS NEUER WON’T DO (EVER)**  

### **Support Ancient Browsers**  
If your app needs to work on IE11, maybe reconsider your life choices. Neuer is for the future, not relics. Nostalgia belongs in museums, not web development.



### **Copy React, Vue, or Angular**  
We’re not here to reinvent the mistakes of the past. If you’re longing for hooks, prop-drilling, or lifecycle hell, feel free to stay with the dinosaurs. Neuer’s here to build **smarter**.



### **Add Fluff Features**  
If it doesn’t make your app faster, better, or more elegant, it’s not happening. Neuer doesn’t do bloat. Save that for frameworks still stuck in 2015.

## **4. COMMUNITY INPUT: MAYBE, IF IT’S BRILLIANT**  

### **Got Ideas? Cool.**  
Submit them. If they’re genius, we’ll implement them. If they’re not, well... thanks for the laugh.



### **No Democracy Here**  
Neuer isn’t a committee. It’s a dictatorship of great ideas. We’ll listen, sure—but if it’s dumb, it’s getting vetoed. No hard feelings. Actually, maybe a few.

---

## **5. FINE PRINT: YOU KNEW THIS WAS COMING**  

### **Neuer’s Roadmap: Subject to Pure Genius**  
This roadmap can and will change at any moment. We reserve the right to pivot, pause, or laugh at your expectations. Complaints? File them alongside your old frameworks.



### **TL;DR: NEUER DELIVERS WHEN WE FEEL LIKE IT.**  
You’ll get groundbreaking features, but only when they’re **perfect**. No rushed releases, no corporate nonsense—just pure engineering brilliance, on our schedule.  

Now stop asking about dates. We’re busy redefining web development.
